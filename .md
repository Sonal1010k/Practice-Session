# 3D Printing: The Future of Design, Engineering, and Manufacturing Technology
It is no secret that the manufacturing, design, and engineering industries have been experiencing a period of rapid change. The adoption of digital technologies, such as AR and VR, combined with advancements in AI and machine learning, has opened new doors to manufacturers, engineers, and designers looking to optimize their processes and provide a more personalized experience for the customers. And while these emerging technologies are expected to usher in a new era of advanced manufacturing, the convergence of 3D printing and digital fabrication techniques has opened up new possibilities for makers everywhere. 
## What is 3D Printing?
3D Printing also known as **Additive Manufacturing or Digital Manufacturing**, is a process of creating a three-dimensional solid object from a digital file. It is a process in which thin layers of material are gradually built up into a three-dimensional final object by a 3D printer nozzle that follows the outlines defined by computer-aided design software (CAD).
3D printing has come a long way since its introduction in the mid-1980s. While it’s not a new technology anymore, it’s certainly one that is still rapidly evolving, gaining ground in many new industries, and could soon be used by consumers on a large scale.
The impact of 3D printing is growing by leaps and bounds. In the past couple of years, this technology has demonstrated an exponential rise in adoption. Recent research projects by Statista forecast that the global market for 3D printing will grow to $37.2 billion in 2026. That is more than twice as much as the $17.4 billion predictions for 2022.
3D printing technology holds great potential. It has been a proven revolutionary and game-changer, particularly in the manufacturing, medical, automotive, and aerospace industries. Its future applications include but are not limited to military, construction, architecture, fashion, education, affordable customized prosthetics, and diagnosis solution among many others. 
In this article, we analyze the progress and *versatility of 3D printing technology, its multifarious applications, and future prospects.*
## Applications of 3D Printing
While 3D printing has been around for decades, its prominence and use have skyrocketed in recent years. Although new 3D printing applications are continually being developed, the ones listed below have garnered the most attention.

### 1. 3D Printing and Manufacturing  
In the manufacturing sector, the term 3D printing is gaining quick ubiquity. 3D printing is evidenced to be a valuable resource in a multitude of ways in the industrial and manufacturing processes. Manufacturers are increasingly using 3D printing in their production processes to manufacture everything from medical devices to consumer electronics to automotive parts. It is being extensively used from developing quick turnaround prototypes to producing small batches of final products. 3D printing techniques, like metal 3D printing, have made it possible to build manufacturing tools and parts in a matter of hours. By optimizing production procedures and cutting costs, producers are able to get their products to market noticeably faster. It is also providing businesses with new opportunities to scale production capacity. The supply chain industries have also been completely transformed by the rippling effects of 3D printing technology.
### 2. 3D Printing and Food 
Food production is one of the most inventive applications of 3D printing technology. 
It is now entirely feasible to produce edible packaging or a full-fledged meal according to individual needs.3D printed food and beverage packaging is gaining traction. Companies are experimenting with a variety of materials, including food-grade edible materials to provide their customers with an outstanding user experience. ‘Modern Meadow’, a 10-year-old New York-based start-up has capitalized on this technology trend by generating flavor-changing restaurant menus and vegan-friendly meat and cheese using bioprinting technology. Bioprinting is also being used by other companies to manufacture dairy-free and lactose-free foods such as ice cream, cheese, and yogurt. 3D printed foods can also bring nutritional benefits. Chef Floyd Restaurant in New York, for example, has developed a dish to help guests manage their blood pressure.

### 3. 3D Printing and Architecture

The two fields of architecture and 3D printing technology are very closely related. Due to substantial advancements, 3D printing has played a vital role in the development of eco-friendly building materials such as carbon-neutral foundations, roof tiles, and bricks. Extrusion, powder bonding, and additive welding are major arenas where 3D printing technology is being applied to construction. 3D printing in architecture has the advantage of enabling higher accuracy, faster construction, reduced labor costs, greater functional integration, and less waste.  In 2016, the first pedestrian bridge in Alcobendas, Madrid, Spain was built using 3D printing technology. The bridge was created utilizing parametric design, as well as computational design allowing for the best possible material distribution while maximizing structural performance. As a futuristic concept, 3D printing technology is being extensively researched as a probable means for constructing extra-terrestrial homes, such as habitats on the Moon or Mars.

### 4. 3D Printing and Medicine

Over the last few years, there have been notable 3D printing breakthroughs in the
 field of medicine. These range from bioprinting, which involves combining biomaterials such as cells to build tissue-like structures that mimic their natural counterparts, to manufacturing patient-specific solutions, such as implants, prosthetics, and dental equipment. Medical equipment manufacturers now have more autonomy in creating new supplies because of low-cost rapid prototyping, which helps to bring new medical equipment to market much faster. Hearing aids, for example, can be instantly generated from a digital file that is matched to a scan of the patient's body. This assures patients can get holistic care at economical costs and with shorter latency. Other significant applications of 3D printing in healthcare include ongoing efforts to build printable organs for transplant patients and the printing of chemicals and proteins to develop novel medicines. 

### 5. 3D printing and Aerospace and Defence 

One of the earliest adopters of 3D printing technology, the Aerospace and Defence Sector now holds a 16.8% market share of the $10.4 billion additive manufacturing business and significantly supports ongoing industry research. Major industry giants like GE, Airbus, Boeing, Safran, and GKN have acknowledged the accruing benefits of 3D printing technology, including cost-effective methods of producing highly complex prototypes, and optimized maintenance, repair, and overhaul of aerospace and military equipment.
Complex brackets and small surveillance drones are among the current defence applications, as are jet engine components and submarine hulls. Electronics 3D printing is a relatively new but rapidly rising area of interest for defence firms. Engineers can now design and create prototypes of complex circuit boards and antennas in-house using this technology. This in turn has led to quick product development by eliminating the requirement to outsource high-value projects to third parties.
